# Information Retrieval and Text Mining
The course covers the basics of information retrieval, including the manner of document representation, term weighting, evaluation metrics used to compare information retrieval systems, and also text classification and clustering.

There are **4 Programming Assignments**, which implement the task of text preprocessing, tf-idf vectors, text classification and text clustering. 
All implementations are done **without applying most Python package**.

- PA1 : Text preprocessing
  - Tokenization
  - Lowercasing everything
  - Stemming using Porterâ€™s algorithm
  - Stopword removal
- PA2 : calculate similarity between documents
  - Transfer each document into a tf-idf vector
  - Calculate cosine similarity between documents
- PA3 : Text (document) classification
  - Multinomial NB Classifier
  - Log Likelihood feature selection
- PA4 : Text (document) clustering
  - HAC clustering
  - Complete-link similarity measure
